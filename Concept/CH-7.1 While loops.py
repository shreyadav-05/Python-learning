#While loop = execute some code WHILE some condition reamins true

# name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Example-1
# while name == "":
#     print("You did not enter your name ")         // clearly shows how While works
#     name =input("Enter your name: ")

# print(f"Hello {name}")

# Example-2
# age = int(input("Enter yout age: "))

# while age<0:
#   print("Age can't be negative ")

# Example-5
