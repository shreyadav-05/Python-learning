#2. FOR LOOP -->> A loop is used to iterate through sequence like list, tuple, or string[iterables]
#when you know how many times repeat
#EX-
for i in range(8):
   print("hello")
   # This will print "hello" 5 times 


l=[1,7,5]

# loop-iterate-

# tuple-
t = [6,576,65,6,687]
for i in t:
   print(i)

# string
S = "Shreya"
for i in S:
   print(i)



# Loop through a string
for char in "cat":
    print(char)

# LOOP through string only printing the first 4 letters of my Name
string="SHREYA YADAV"

# Loop through a dictionary
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
for key in d:

# This makes for loops flexible â€” they work with many data types by iterating over their elements in order.


#RANGE funciton in python
'''
The range() fucntion in python is used to gerante a sequence of number.

range() specify the start, stop and step-size

'''
for i in range(0,20,5):  #t will generate a sequence starting from 0 up to (but not including, n-1) 20, with a step size of 5.
